## Git commands

This page will have a list of Git commands which I use/intend to use on a daily basis. For commands which are new to me, I will write up a short description on what it does in the background:

* git push --set-upstream origin branchname
* git remote -v
The above command will let you view origin (remote repository)
* git config --list --show-origin
* git checkout {branchname}
The above command will change branch on the repo, it doesn't create a new branch.
* git checkout -b {branchname}
The above command will create a new branch and will also change the branch.
